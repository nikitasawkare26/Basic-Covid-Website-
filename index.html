        <h2>About COVID-19 </h2>

        <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global
		pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory 
		syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
        coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
        Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms 
		and recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill 
		and require medical attention.
        </p>
        <p>
         The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid 
		 particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range
		 from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.You can be infected by 
		 breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching
		 a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more
		 easily indoors and in crowded settings.
